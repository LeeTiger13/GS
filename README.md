In order to address the issue that existing crop germplasm resources have not been fully identified and studied in depth, a crop whole genome prediction platform has been established. 
This platform offers a variety of modules for preprocessing phenotypic and genotypic data, and through multiple models for analysis, it can achieve relatively accurate prediction results.
The reference results are shown belowï¼š
